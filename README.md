# virtualroadtrip
Supporting a virtual roadtrip with maps, legs, and getting data from relevant places

files:
- data/Directions_from_Battery_Bikeway_New_York_NY_USA_to_Lost_World_Caverns_Lost_World_Road_Lewisburg_WV_USA.csv: a route specifying through which waypoints the route goes from the start to finish
- showroute.py: draws the route specified in the route csv on Google maps, and adds legs based on the activity
